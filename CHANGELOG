ver. 2.0.2, released 2016.mm.dd
-------------------------------

Bug fixes:

* #22 - missing values in saved diagrams
* Diagrams of RAW reflection values are output without (meaningless) error limits.

Additions:

* #23 - normalisation to monitor count

Changes, improvements:

* The range of gammas now retrieved at middle 2 theta.
* Output text files written with OS-specific end-of-line (\r\n on Windows).
* Output text formats: only .dat (spaces), .csv (commas); .txt is discontinued.
* Output dialogs: gamma slicing initialized with gamma range of selected datasets. 
  Gamma degrees updated when count changes.

ver. 2.0.1, released 2016.06.29
-------------------------------

New features:

* Datasets with different 2theta and/or gamma values (i.e. angle maps) are now properly combined.
* Some relevant warnings are now shown on the statusbar.

Bug fixes:

* #1442 - crash when normalizing to invalid monitor counts or delta time
* #1443 - NaN errors shown by the diffractogram plot

Changes in code:

* statubar-messaging
* semi-major code refactoring, rearranged modules and source code files
* new specialized types and typedefs to improve type safety and self-documentation of code
* cache classe to handle angle maps
* Fixed bugs #1442, #1443, and a number of small things

STeCa2-2.0.0.1, released 2016.06.09
-----------------------------------
* First release for user acceptance testing


Features planned for the next version (2.0.2, probably by the end of July)
==========================================================================

Loading of TIFF and Mar files. X-ray - type data + beam offset handling.
Filtering of results by their fitting errors (standard deviations).
Faster interpolation; all datasets feature taking into account different tth angles.
