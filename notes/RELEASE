====== How to make a release ======

Merge release candidate into master,
tag it as vX.Y.ZrcN,
push it to origin and to upstream.

Ensure that CI services (Travis, Appveyor under github; different targets under buildbot)
all show green light.

rdesktop -a 16 -N scgbuild:3310 &

On virtual Win10 desktop,

- find C:\basedir\Steca-master-Win10\build\.build\Steca-Installer.exe

- try installation, try Steca.

- point browser to https://github.com/scgmlz/Steca/releases,
    draft new release (tag vX.Y.Z, name idem),
    and directly upload the installer.

- (alternative: scp C:\basedir\Steca-master-Win10\build\.build\Steca-Installer.exe you@yourbox:)


That's all.
